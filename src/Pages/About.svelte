            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am a Highschool student studying at Awty International School in Houston. As a native french, my mother’s tongue  is french, but I also know English as I have lived in the United States since 2012, as well as Spanish (learnt through classes at school). Nowadays, I am learning Japanese on my own, because Japan’s culture has always interested me since childhood. In school, I am mostly interested in scientific classes, especially Maths as well as technology. Indeed, I want to grow as a software engineer as it regroups both classes, whether it is with the problem solving skills or the programmation part. (Quick note, I own two parakeets).</p>
